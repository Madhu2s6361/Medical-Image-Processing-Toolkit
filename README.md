# Medical-Image-Processing-Toolkit
This project implements a simple and efficient medical image processing toolkit designed for MRI and X-ray preprocessing. It performs essential enhancement steps used in real-world diagnostic workflows such as grayscale conversion, smoothing, contrast adjustment, and edge detection.

##Features
1. Load an image from local storage or direct URL
2. Convert image to grayscale
3. Remove noise using Gaussian filtering
4. Enhance contrast
5. Detect edges (Sobel method)
6. Display each output in separate windows
7. Save processed images automatically

##Concepts Used
1. Image preprocessing
2. Grayscale conversion
3. Gaussian noise reduction
4. Sobel edge detection
5. Contrast enhancement
6. File handling and saving outputs
7. Basic understanding of medical imaging workflow
